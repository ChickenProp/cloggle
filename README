OVERVIEW

cloggle provides a Clojure interface to OpenGL through JOGL. It is currently
very thin. Almost all opengl functions should be supported, but due to
implementation details, there are some which may not work yet (see bug #2). At
the moment only the GL interface is implemented; there is no support for
GLAutoDrawable or the like.

A GL object can be interfaced with using the ctx macro, which initialises a
context for all calls to opengl functions which occur within its body. This is a
dynamic context, so it will be in effect for functions called from within the
body of ctx. The current context object can be accessed through the variable
opengl-context.

Within a context, functions and fields defined by opengl are exposed in the
obvious manner: GL_FIELD, (glFunc arg1 arg2 ...). Functions operate only on the
current context object; there is no way to pass a different one. But you can
make a new call to ctx, or just use the java interop to the JOGL API directly.

cloggle also provides the beg-end macro, which wraps its body between calls to
glBegin and glEnd.

Illustrative example (not working code):
    (use 'net.philh.cloggle)
    (def gl-obj (get-gl-object-somehow))
    (ctx gl-obj
      (glMatrixMode GL_PROJECTION)
      (glOrtho 0 300 0 300 1 128)
      (glMatrixMode GL_MODELVIEW)
      (glTranslated 0 0 -10)

      (glClear GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
      (glClear GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
      (beg-end GL_TRIANGLES
        (glVertex3i 30 0 0)
        (glVertex3i 0 30 0)
        (glVertex3i 0 0 0)))

BUGS

No typecasting is performed. If a function expects a Double, you can't pass it an
Integer, Float, Ratio, or anything else that isn't a Double.

There has been very little testing, so it's likely that others exist.

FUTURE PLANS

* Fix bugs.
* Rename functions and fields: glMatrixMode -> matrix-mode, GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT
  -> depth-buffer-bit.
* When the 'same' function goes by multiple names (eg. glVertex -> glVertex2f,
  glVertex2d, glVertex3f, etc.), make it available under a catch-all (eg.
  glVertex, or simply vertex if the rename has already happened).
* Add support for GLAutoDrawable, GLEventListener and friends.
